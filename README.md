# 'flexcards' theme for Bolt CMS
## Testing Bootstrap 4 for Bolt
Flexcards is a Bolt CMS theme (>= 3.2) working with Bootstrap 4 'cards' and jQuery for a simple, dynamic and flexible grid layout. Basic themes from Bolt CMS are distributed with 'Foundation' support and bootstrap. This experimental work is heading towards a simplified file structure. It skips Foundation (css and js) completely. For extending this templates you will need to work with .twig and Bootstrap 4 to change the template files for your needs. Please be aware that my theme work here is completely experimental. And of course every support from other Bolt CMS developers for getting the code to something worthy is very welcome.

```Before you start using this experimental work you should probably read about what browser versions are supported with Bootstrap 4. Have a look here:```[Browsers supported](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/browsers-devices/)

## Bootstrap 4/jQuery/.twig Resources
All the scripts and css are included in the theme. Here some links to get more information about using this resources for your own work:

 * [bootstrap >=4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) as framework
 * [twig >=2](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/) I used this docs for working with Bolt CMS templates/themes
 * [jQuery >=3](https://jquery.com/download/) for the slim version
