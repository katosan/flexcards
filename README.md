# 'flexcards' theme for Bolt CMS
Flexcards is a Bolt CMS theme (>= 3.2) working with Bootstrap 4 'cards' and jQuery for a simple, dynamic and flexible grid layout. Basic themes from the Bolt CMS developers are normally distributed with 'Foundation' support and a heavy nested .twig structure. This experimental theme work here goes back to a simplified file structure and skips Foundation CSS and Javascript completely for theme development. You will need to work with .twig, Bootstrap 4 (CSS) and jQuery (JS) to change the template files for your needs. Please be aware that my theme work here is completely experimental. Every support for getting the code to something worthy is very welcome. Please fork.
