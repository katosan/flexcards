# 'flexcards' theme for Bolt CMS
## Testing Bootstrap 4 for Bolt
Flexcards is a Bolt CMS theme (>= 3.2) working with Bootstrap 4 'cards' and jQuery for a simple, dynamic and flexible grid layout. Basic themes from Bolt CMS are distributed with 'Foundation' support and bootstrap. This experimental work is heading towards a simplified file structure. It skips Foundation (css and js) completely. For extending this templates you will need to work with .twig and Bootstrap 4 to change the template files for your needs. Please be aware that my theme work here is completely experimental. And of course every support from other Bolt CMS developers for getting the code to something worthy is very welcome.
