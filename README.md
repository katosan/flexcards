# 'flexcards' theme for Bolt CMS
## Testing Bootstrap 4 for Bolt
Flexcards is a Bolt CMS theme (>= 3.2) working with Bootstrap 4 'cards' and jQuery for a simple, dynamic and flexible grid layout. Basic theme shipped with Bolt CMS comes with 'Foundation' framework support and a heavy nested file structure/macros. Flexcards skips foundation css/js completely. For extending flexcards you will need to work with .twig and Bootstrap 4. Please be aware that this work here is completely experimental. Of course, as of this very very alpha version every further support from Bolt CMS theme developers is very welcome. Please fork or file issues at least :)

:no_bell: 
```Before you start using this experimental work you should probably read about what browser versions are supported with Bootstrap 4. Have a look here:```[Browsers supported](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/browsers-devices/)

## Bootstrap 4/jQuery/.twig Resources
All the scripts and css are included in the theme. Here some links to get more information about using this resources for your own work:

 * [bootstrap >=4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) as framework
 * [twig >=2](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/) I used this docs for working with Bolt CMS templates/themes
 * [jQuery >=3](https://jquery.com/download/) for the slim version
 * [theter](http://tether.io/) in case you want to use bootstrap tooltips
